glGo Changelog
--------------

2003-11-30 - Version 0.0.4
    * Added Graph panel to the player dialog. The data is extracted from the SGF index.
      You can also open a single frame with the Graph using either the popup menu on
      a player or the menu item "Show graph of" which lets you input any playername.
    * Added Status-Friend/Neutral/Bozo radiogroup to the popupmenu on a player.
      Note: These radiobuttons appear to work only on Windows, not GTK. I have no idea
      why. Looks like a wxPython bug? No big deal, you get the same functionality by
      opening the dialog with "Edit" and selecting Friend/Neutral/Bozo there.

2003-11-22 - Version 0.0.3
    * Added ability to scan directories for SGF files. The SGF headers are read and stored
      in an index file. For each player you can see the existing games from the scanned
      directories. If new games are saved into the directories, you need to manually run
      the scan again, as the playermanager won't automatically detect new files.
      The feature is meant as addition to the glGo autosave feature.
      The "Cleanup games" menuitem will look for entries without SGF file and remove the
      entry. This is useful if you manually deleted some SGF files from previously scanned
      directories.
      The games tables can be sorted, left/right click on the column labels.
    * Added a choice box to filter the player list by your customized flags.
    * Implemented a workaround for Windows 9x which does not know about home directories.
      It should work automatically and find the glGo install folder from the registry
      entry the glGo installer wrote. Hope it works, I don't have Win98 installed. :)

2003-11-16 - Version 0.0.2
    * Added support for custom flags. You can define up to 5 flags yourself, for example
      "Escaper", "Cool dude", "Sucky play"... and then assign each flag for each player
      in your database. To activate a flag, go to menu "Edit", "Edit flags", give it some
      text and enable the checkbox. The flags can then be set in the player dialogs within
      the playermanager and glGo.
    * Database can now store neutral players, too, not only friends/bozos.
    * Added a "Cleanup". This removes all neutral players without comments and custom
      flags. Use with care.
    * Improved the standalone GUI. Win32 version now also shows an icon in the player
      list (in 0.0.1 the icon only appeared on Linux). Added icon for bozo.
    * Some fixes to the commandline version. Added --flags option to display the new flags.
    * This version requires glGo 0.0.5.5a or newer.

2003-11-12 - Version 0.0.1
    * Initial release
