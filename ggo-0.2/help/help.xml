    <para>gGo is a Go board, <link linkend="sgf">SGF</link> editor and
      client for internet Go servers written in Java. Go is an ancient
      boardgame, very common in Japan, China and Korea.</para>
    <para>This manual describes the basic usage of gGo.</para>

    <!-- Section: SGF -->

    <section>
      <title>SGF</title>
      <anchor id="sgf"/>
      <para>SGF (Smart Game Format) files are a simple and effective
	way to store records of two-player board games. File
	information is saved as plain text, which makes the files very
	small and easy to handle or store. Game information is stored
	in a tree-based format - in other words, there is one main
	linear sequence of moves, with any alternatives that have been
	entered into the record branching away from that main
	sequence. These branches may have their own branches and so
	on.</para>
      <para>Because an SGF can contain much information - including
	but not limited to board setup, markings, variations, and
	extensive comments - programs such as gGo have been created.
	gGo provides a powerful, easy-to-use interface for creating,
	editing and viewing SGF files.</para>
      <para>
        But there are some very old games out on the web in an older
	format. gGo is able to convert this format to SGF
	automatically when loading those files.
      </para>

    <!-- Section: XML

  <section>
  <title>XML</title>
  <anchor id="xml"/>
  <para>XML is a modern file format and not yet much used in the
    Go world.</para>
  <para>Jago is able to load and save Go games in XML format.
    Unlike SGF, which is a standardized format, such a standard
        does not exist for XML yet. The author of Jago created an own
    XML specification.</para>
  <para>gGo is using Jagos XML definitions and currently able to
        load XML games saved with Jago. gGo is not yet able to save
    games in XML format, this but this feature will be implemented
    somewhen in the future.</para>

      <para>Once the comment editor has the window focus, and you want
	to continue using the <keycap>cursor</keycap> and
	<keycap>Home</keycap>/<keycap>End</keycap> keys for game
	navigation, just move the mouse over the board to return the
	focus to the board again.</para>

	<para>If you have a wheelmouse, move the mouse over the board
	  and use the wheel for fast navigation.</para>

        <title>File</title>
        <section>
          <title>New</title>
          <para>This lets you create a new SGF. You will be prompted
	    for some basic game information (white player, black
	    player, board size, komi, and handicap).</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Open</title>
          <para>This will open a stored SGF file into the current
	    window. gGo will remember which directory you store your
	    SGFs in and return there next time you perform the Open,
	    Save, or Save As functions during the same session. The
	    file does not have to have an .sgf extension as long as it
	    is in the SGF format (sometimes downloaded files are saved
	    without the extension).</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Save</title>
          <para>This will save the SGF you are currently editing. If
	    the SGF has not yet been saved to a file, you will be
	    prompted for a filename. If you want to save an existing
	    file under another name or in another location, use the
	    Save As option.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Save As</title>
          <para>This will let you define which location and name the
	    SGF file will be saved under. Use this to save edited, or
	    alternate copies of SGFs without overwriting the
	    original.</para>

      <para>
        gGo offers advanced navigation features by using the mouse
	only, to provide a comfortable interface to the user. Mouse
	gestures are implemented as button and wheel gestures.
      </para>
      <para>
        These navigation gestures are an additional feature, they
	offer basically the same as the toolbar or keyboard control,
	but are meant to make a convinient way of navigation through a
	game available.
