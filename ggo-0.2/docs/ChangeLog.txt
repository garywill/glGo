gGo Changelog
-------------

02-10-27 - Version 0.2
    * Implemented support for teaching games.
    * Added a new menuitem "Change komi" in own game windows. Also, when the
      opponent requests a komi change, a confirmation dialog is displayed.
    * Added a new menuitem "Change handicap".
    * Added handicap support for boardsizes 9x9 and 13x13.
    * Bugfix: Finished observed games were not removed from the observe hash.
    * Friends/Ignore list are now alphabetically sorted.
    * Bugfix: Jumping several moves with the slider occasionally displayed stones
      in the wrong color, if the stone on the board was exchanged within the
      jumped moves.
    * Bugfix: Save sgf exited with a NullPointerException if a stone got removed
      in move 0.
    * Implemented customizable textmarks. Shift-leftclick lets the user input a
      text for the mark.
    * Bugfix: When loading a game or initializing a new game, the edit tools did not
      reset to stone mark.
    * Added some extensive logging for IGS moves, hunting for the move-doesn't-occur
      bug. Found and fixed a possible reason for this. (Logging is disabled in the
      official release, only used in the previews.)
    * Implemented tables in the PlayerInfo dialog for Stored and SGF games. The user
      can right-click on a game line to get a popup menu for "look", "load" etc.
    * When opening a game with "look", the Date and disconnection notes are displayed
      in the board window.
    * In score mode of own games, display stone removing and typed-done message in
      the board window say textfield.
    * Double-clicking (left button) on observed IGS boards adds the coordinate to the
      kibitz inputfield (user request).
    * Bugfix: If both players have the same defs, automatch board did not open. Argh!
    * Bugfix: When reloading an own game, don't repaint all previous moves.
    * Improved reloading own games on own disconnection. Game window will be resued,
      and the "Adjourn" button toggles to "Load" (this only worked when the opponent
      disconnected before).
    * Bugfix: When resuming to observe a game after disconnect/reconnect, game title
      was not set properly.
    * Bugfix: Game title was not set properly in trailed games.
    * Added refresh, notify and message buttons to the playerinfo dialog.
    * Added two new dialogs to read and compose messages.
    * Added three menuitems to the IGS terminal window: Start teaching game, read messages and
      User stats. You can type all of those in the terminal as well, same result.
    * Bugfix: When loading an adjourned game without moves, the board was not opened.
    * Bugfix: When opening a new game while hen already observing, occasionally the new
      game was not initialized properly. However, this still can happen with "automatch",
      this is a problem in the IGS protocol. No problem with "match".
    * Replaced the Home icon.
    * Bugfix: In the playerinfo dialog the Shouts checkbox sent "toggle shouts". Must
      be "toggle shout".

02-11-10 - Version 0.1.5
    * Changed to Java 1.4.1 compiler.
    * Implemented Parser for Jago XML game files - read-only
    * Implemented Parser for UGF files - read-only
    * Added a gGo-own game format. This is basically a serialized game tree. It loads
      and saves very fast. It is currently pretty useless, but I have some furthers ideas
      for later improvements, like game collections.
    * Removed the ggo.sgf package and replaced with ggo.parser.
    * When scoring own IGS games, score, territory and captures are displayed in the sidebar.
      The counting does not recognize false eyes yet and scores them as a point. This has to
      be fixed.
    * Added quick-access to the player table: Double-click left on a player sends stats,
      double-click middle OR double-click left + shift sends match.
    * Playertable now sorts the names alphabetically, when the primary search is by rank.
    * Observed games open significantly faster now, not displaying all moves. However, the
      old behaviour can be turned on in the IGS tab of the preferences dialog.
    * In own games, after the first move a full board update is forced. Windows seems to
      have problems with that.
    * Bugfix: Loading adjourned games did not draw the stones. Updated forced now.
    * Replaced the Shouts and Quiet checkbox menuitems in the Control menu with a menuitem
      My Stats, which shows an extented playerinfo dialog including toggles and defaults.
    * When an own game has finished, send 'tell' instead 'say' when the player types in
      the say commandline.
    * Added a gGo-internal command: showgame <playername> - Displays current game of this
      player. Terminal commandline usage only. This is a workaround for some IGS bug not
      displaying games while scoring in "stats" and "user".
    * Bugfix: Autoupdater players and games database must be cleared after disconnect.
    * Added a '#' prompt to the IGS terminal.

02-09-22 - Version 0.1.4
    * Added french translation. Thanks to Elvire Scheibling.
    * Made modified Java-thin the Unix default look and feel.
    * Bugfix: Results and stored games were not shown in the playerinfo dialog anymore.
      Stored label was changed to be initially empty when the dialog opens.
    * Added friend/neutral/ignore control to playerinfo dialog.
    * Added trail button to playerinfo dialog.
    * When calling stats and a playerinfo dialog of a certain player is already open, reuse
      this dialog.
    * Client now beeps on being beeped
    * Bugfix: Autoupdater is not reinstantiated on a new connection. The data which adjourned
      games should be reloaded was lost in that process when reconnected.
    * After a disconnect/reconnect formerly observed games with still open board windows are
      resumed.
    * User gets notified with a messagebox when a disconnected opponent is online again.
    * "Adjourn" button changes to "Reload" when an own game was adjourned.
    * Bugfix: The last name from the friends/ignore list was not removed.
    * Bugfix: Block sending move coordinates when clicking on a board with a finished game.
    * Bugfix: When kibitzes are added while the user browses through earlier moves in an observed
      game, the kibitzes were not saved in the last move, but in the move the user currently was.
    * Added a timestamp feature to observed games. If enabled, it will print the move number and
      time into the kibitz field. Might be usefor for tournament games.
    * Added a "gGo on the Web" menuitem in the Help menu, opening the gGo webpage in an external
      browser.
    * Changed the Match Dialog to a subclass of JFrame, so it gets an icon in the Windows taskbar.
    * Incoming match requests play a sound, this is controlled by the chat-sound toggle.
    * Added a dialog to import SGF files from the clipboard.
    * Bugfix: When more than one match requests are incoming, gGo messed up the time settings.
    * Bugfix: Some accounts have an IP adress instead of email, the stats parser failed on this.
    * Bugfix: When observing and starting a new game, distribute the old observed moves to the proper
      board. When playing, block starting a new observation (IGS will block that anyways).
    * Fixed missing and wrong translations in the preferences dialog.

02-09-15 - Version 0.1.3
    * Added spanish translation. Thanks to Jorge Canovas Zaragoza.
    * Implemented support for "trail" command.
    * Implemented support for automatic reloading of adjourned observed games. If possible,
      the existing board is reused. If it was already closed, a new board is opened. This only
      happens if a game was observed while the adjourn occured.
    * Implemented support for automatic reloading of own played games. If the board window of the
      before adjourned game is still open, the reloaded game will continue in this window.
    * Added the player popup to the White/Black name labels of IGS boards. Right click on the
      label opens the popup. This offers convinient access to stats or other info.
    * Changed the text for the friends/ignore dialog. "Bozo" was not understood by
      every non-native english speaker.
    * Bugfix: Refresh did not parse the game status properly in special cases.
    * Bugfix: When observing IGS game, occasionally moves were skipped. (Hopefully fixed, this
      one is tricky!)
    * When the player list is set available only, and a new game starts, the players are
      removed from the list.
    * Board draws and resizes faster (significant on my old PII box).
    * Don't play a stone sound when hitting Refresh in IGS games.
    * When the player info dialog is called, it opens instantly and updates the results of "stored"
      and "results" later. Closes feature request 609557.

02-09-05 - Version 0.1.2
    * Added new icons from tweet for the startup frame and the taskbar icons.
    * Added a menu item "Show updates" in the IGS terminal window, to display the autoupdate
      messages. Request by tweet, I guess noone else really needs this.
    * Resuming games with GnuGo is now possible.
    * Bugfix: List of stored games in the player dialog was occasionally not showing all games.
    * Player dialog sends "stored -xxx" and "results -xxx" now.
    * Bugfix: SGF files from IGS displayed a wrong number of captured stones in scoring
    * Added "Edit game" button to the sidebar of IGS/GTP games. Added "Sychronize" button to the
      sidebar of a mirror frame. A edit mirror board is reused if another one was already opened.
    * Added an option "Display info" in the IGS tab of the preferences dialog. If disabled, the
      info messageboxes for IGS observed games don't show up anymore. Occasionally they are annoying.
    * Bugfix: When the themepack file was not found, fall back to system default instead crashing.
    * "look" command now displays the captures.
    * Bugfix: Linefeeds in the IGS terminal window got munched.
    * Implemented a friends and bozos list. Bozo results in blocking tell and match requests.
      A filter to display friends only can be applied to the player table.
    * Bozos appear red in the player table, friends blue.
    * Added Type column to the games table.
    * Game/players table column widths are now fixed.

02-08-18 - Version 0.1.1
    * Implemented Internationalization support. German translation is available.
    * Bugfix: Undo in own games did not work properly.
    * Bugfix: On Java 1.3 sometimes the editor did not open from an observed game.
    * Bugfix: NullPointerException in score mode of own IGS games.
    * When entering score mode of own IGS games, territory marks are drawn. Instead of
      waiting until the first dead stone was removed.
    * Bugfix: Exit timer needs to be stopped when a new connection is established.
    * Those game setup tells from cgoban are now filtered out. Maybe implemented later, but
      for now the opening chat window is just annoying. Only displayed in the terminal.
    * Redirected stderr output to a file, default ~/.ggo.log. You can customize this with
      commandline parameters, run "ggo -help" for details. If gGo crashes for you, please
      mail me this file. Careful, if you restart gGo the old logfile is overwritten.
    * When typing "game 123" or so in the terminal, the game window is not opened. Annoying.

02-08-07 - Version 0.1
    * Renamed project to gGo and switched to beta.
    * Implemented a dialog for player info.
    * Fixed white-stone-overlap bug.
    * Replaced "ayt" with alternating "who" and "games" commands in the 10 minute timer, to keep
      the player and games database up to date.
    * Added a 5 pixel margin to the comment/kibitz textarea.
    * Implemented tiling for boards and match dialogs.
    * Implemented location save and restore for the IGS client frames.
    * Fixed a bug when in observed games suddenly a wrong variation appeared.
    * Added an option to display the sidebar on the right or left.
    * Bugfix: When requesting a board refresh, block the request if the game is neither played or observed.
    * IGS main window now shows the title depending on the login name.
    * Bugfix: In an incoming match, gGo adjusted white-black, but should not do that in this case.
    * Replaced old qGo application icons with a new gGo icon. Thanks to tweet for drawing them.
    * Bugfix: When typed in the terminal, automatch games sometimes did not open.
    * Added observe/match/automatch buttons to the chatter toolbar.
    * Disconnect button now sends "exit" and then waits for the connection to close, instead of a brute
      force connection termination.
