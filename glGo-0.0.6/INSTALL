                               glGo Installation
                               -----------------

Windows
-------

This should be simple. For Windows there is a common installer. Double-click on
the downloaded glGo-xxx.exe file and follow the instructions.

The Windows build is statically linked to wxWindows, so you don't need to bother
about this.

You need OpenGL libraries installed, they are included in the standard
installation of Windows 98 and newer (not recommended) or come with your
hardware driver. See section Requirements in the Readme file or the manual for
details. Summarized, install a suitable driver for your graphiccard which is
distributed by the cards vendor. Do not use the Microsoft driver.

The glGo installer includes the redistributable OpenAL library published by
Creative (http://developer.creative.com/).

The installer includes the required SDL and Python runtime libaries.

If you chose to install GNU Go together with glGo, you find the gnugo.exe
file in the installation folder, and some GNU Go related documentation in
the docs folder.


Linux
-----

The selfextracting installer is used with "sh glGo-xxx.sh". You need to be
root or use the sudo utility to run it. (I am investigating if this is possible
to change as it is not really required to install glGo with root permissions.)

The installer takes the following commandline parameters:
sh glGo-xxx.sh -gui        -  Install glGo via GUI (default)
sh glGo-xxx.sh -remove     -  Remove glGo via GUI
sh glGo-xxx.sh -install    -  Install glGo via commandline interface
sh glGo-xxx.sh -uninstall  -  Uninstall glGo via commandline interface

It does not matter if you use the GUI or the commandline interface, just a
matter of taste. But I like the idea of Linux GUI installers.

The target directory is /opt/glGo and it will create a symlink to
/usr/local/bin/glGo. Uninstall scripts are located in the target directory. The
user configuration is found in $HOME/.glGo/. Please remove this directory
manually after uninstalling.

In any case you require OpenGL libraries installed, but they are installed
together with your hardware driver. In worst case, install the Mesa libraries
for software-only rendering, but this is not recommended

You need the following SDL libraries: libsdl, libsdl_ttf and libsdl_image. They
are available with all major Linux distributions. If you don't have them already
installed, get them from your distribution. In case try "ldd glGo" to check the
dependencies.

You need the Python 2.3 runtime library installed.

For the sound system you need either the OpenAL or the SDL_mixer runtime
libraries installed. They should be included in every Linux distribution. Unlike
Windows, OpenAL is not included in the Linux glGo installer, as it is to be
preferred to use your Linux distribution version.
If neither libopenal nor libSDL_mixer are available, glGo should still run, but
without sound output.

Here are the most importantant dependencies. Nothing special, but you might
need to install some library from your distribution.

* libgtk 1.2
* libjpeg
* libpng 1.2
* libz
* libGL
* libGLU
* libSDL 1.2
* libSDL_image 1.2
* libSDL_ttf 2.0
* libfreetype
* libpython 2.3

Optional for sound output:

* libopenal
* libSDL_mixer

GNU Go is not included in the Linux installer. Please install it from your
distribution, it is included in almost any, or compile it yourself. Make sure
the gnugo binary is found in your PATH environment, so glGo will find it.
Common locations are /usr/local/bin, /usr/bin or /usr/games/bin.

If you installed glGo in an unusual directory, you can use the "-s" commandline
option to point to the shared data directory.
Example: glGo -s /home/foobar/myprogs/coolapps/glGo/share.
Another possibility is to set the environment variable GLGO_SHARED_PATH, for
example in bash: export GLGO_SHARED_PATH=/home/foobar/myprogs/coolapps/glGo/share
The "-s" option has higher priority than the environment variable. If neither is
given glGo will search for the shared directory in the folder the binary is
located, /usr, /usr/local, /opt, $HOME and $HOME/glGo. If no shared directory is
found, glGo will fail to start. If you keep the default directories in the
installation and don't move files around later, you do not need to worry about
this.

The sound libraries (libalsound.so and libsdlsound.so) are located in
/opt/glGo/lib. If you really need to move this directory around, you need to
tell glGo the location of these libraries, else sound won't work. You can do
this by setting the environment LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the new directory.
