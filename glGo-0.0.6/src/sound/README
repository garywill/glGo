glGo soundlibs
--------------

What the hell is this?

To relief glGo from some dependencies on Linux, the glGo binary is not linked
against the SDL_mixer and OpenAL libraries. Instead, it uses dlopen to load
libalsound.so and libsdlsound.so at runtime. As result, if OpenAL or SDL_mixer
are not installed on the users system, glGo will still run, just without sound,
instead of failing to start because dependencies are not met.

The only file linked with glGo is sound.cpp, which serves as interface to the
shared libraries. sound.cpp will then try to dlopen libalsound.so and
libsdlsound.so, which are linked against OpenAL respectively SDL_mixer. The
dlopen mechanism is wrapped into PLIB utilities functions, which makes porting
to Windows much easier. libplibul is required anyways by libplibfnt, so this
does not add any overhead.

To disable the shared library mechanism, compile with -DNO_DYNAMIC_LOADING. The
build script won't work then, but you can easily fix the Makefile.am for this.

I am aware this makes the building process more complicated, but it makes it
more convinient for the enduser, which I value higher.

The OpenAL sound can be tweaked in the al_sound.c file, see the #defines at the
beginning of the file. By default ogg files are loaded using a selfmade ogg
loader, which requires libvorbisfile. Basically OpenAL could decode the oggfiles,
too (you can set that via #define), but there are some small frequency problems
with the soundfiles I use. With other files it should work, though. On Win32
the OpenAL lib must be linked against libvorbisfile. For my Win32 release build
I do a static link. Otherwise ogg.dll, vorbis.dll and vorbisfile.dll need to
be installed - something I try to avoid.
If you want to get rid of all these ogg problems, switch the ogg support off
and use wav files, which has a simple loader with ALut.

This library is probably only usable for glGo. However, if anyone feels like
copying, using or modifying this code, you can do so under the terms of the
GNU General Public License. But I really doubt anyone has use for this. :*)
If you do, drop me a note.
