The white stones are
overlayed with an image for a slight grain effect. The goban will always have a
wooden texture, switching this off getting an orange board makes little sense.
The stone textures can be disabled, resulting in plain black and white stones.
This will improve performance, but the overall quality drops significantly.
Probably in future versions disabled textures might be removed. Textures don't
hurt the performance much, and they add quite a lot to the overall scene.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2873297"></a>Textures quality</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>The texture quality can be set to low and high. When zooming in,
the difference should be obvious. Low quality textures will appear blocky. When
running in hardware mode, high quality textures do not drop performance much, so
it is a good idea to use them. However, when running in software mode high
quality textures are a speed killer, so for software mode it is highly
recommended to switch to low quality. When the board is not zoomed in closely,
the difference is not too noticeable.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2873318"></a>Light</h3></div></div><div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2873324"></a>Reflections</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>Light causes the reflection effect on the black stones, which look
quite similar to the stones in the Java version of gGo. When rotating the board,
the reflection will slider over the stone surface relatively to the light
source, which is placed slightly to the upper left. Think about a lamp shining
just over your head.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2873341"></a>Shadows</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>Shadows significantly add to the overall 3D scene. The shadows are
drawn relative to the light source. Basically they are just another light
effect, but can be toggled off independent from light to improve performance in
software mode while keeping the reflection effect. Shadows require light to be
enabled.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2873359"></a>Blending</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>Blending is an important effect. All antialias effects (see below)
depend on blending enabled. Blending means that the alpha value of each pixel
will be calculated when drawing the scene. When you take the border of a stone
or a grid line, the pixels close to the wooden board will have a lower alpha
value, so the borderline will not appear blocky, instead the edge of the black
grid lines or the stones will be smooth. When blending is disabled, all
antialias effects will not work. Blending is a recommended feature, however it
can be quite performance costly on software mode. You need to find out if
trading the performance for quality is worth it. When running in hardware mode,
blending is very fast and should be enabled.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2873398"></a>Antialiasing</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>You might notice the grid lines and stone edges can get blocky,
which is called aliasing. The effect which prevents this is called antialiasing.
glGo supports two antialias modes, a third is accessible via the configuration
of your 3D driver.</p><p>Two simple but quite effective antialias settings affect the drawing
of lines and stones only. This are the line and stone antialias settings in
glGo. You find them in the <span class="guimenu">View</span> menu. Blending must be
enabled, else this will show little effect.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2873428"></a>Line antialiasing</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>This will affect the grid on the goban and smooth the lines when
rotating the board. If turned off, the lines will appear blocky. The quality of
this effect depends on the capability of your graphic card.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2873443"></a>Stone antialiasing</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>This will affect the board of stones to appear smooth. The effect
should be obvious when toggling this on and off. This is a recommended feature
which does not affect performance much and even is fast in software mode, so
there is little reason to turn this off.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2873459"></a>Scene antialiasing</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>Scene antialiasing will improve not only the lines and stones but
the complete display. To enable this feature, turn on the
<span class="guimenuitem">Antialiasing scene</span> menu item in glGo. You can
configure if low or high quality should be used. This scene antialiasing effect
can be very slow on older hardware. It only runs in hardware mode on very new
cards (hardware supported accumulation buffer, to be specific), so this is quite
slow when it is not supported by the card, as the CPU has to do the work. If you
have a fast computer, on low quality setting it might still be performant
enough. But with lots of stones on the board and on high quality settings this
eats CPU power for breakfast unless your card has the above mentioned hardware
accumulation buffer. I think Geforce4 has it, but not sure.</p><p>Modern graphic cards have a feature called Multisampling, which
will also smooth the overall scene. glGo will automatically turn multisampling
on if it is supported by the hardware.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="images/tip.jpg"></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p>You need to enable full screen antialiasing (FSAA) in your 3D

the window but instead first drawn into an image (a "texture") and then this
texture is drawn on the window. The advantage of this feature is the display is
buffered in the texture, and when you for example minimize and restore the
window, redrawing the whole scene will be much faster as only the already
existing texture is drawn again, not the whole scene again. Also when opening a
menu or a dialog the cached texture will be used to redraw the window. Only when
the board changes, like when a stone is played, the scene will be redrawn. This
feature also prevents some display artifacts when other windows overlap the glGo
board.</p><p>The disadvantage is a minimal performance drop as drawing the
texture to the screen takes an extra step in the whole process, but this effect
is minimal when running with hardware acceleration. Actually this feature will
rather improve the overall performance as the scene does not need to be redrawn
constantly when something happens to the window, like another window or dialog
is laid over it. However, if you are running in software mode, disabling Render
to texture will speed up glGo significantly.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2873588"></a>Blurring</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>When blurring is enabled, the whole scene will be slightly smeared.
You maybe know this effect from common paint software, most offer a feature when
you can smear the existing image with a brush.</p><p>Blurring only works if Render to texture is enabled. When the
texture is drawn to the screen and blurring is enabled, it will be drawn several
times having a small offset in each turn - this is called jittering. Each image
will be blended into each other, and as each image has a faint offset to each
other the whole scene will be slightly worn away. When Render to texture is
disabled, this feature cannot work, as then the whole scene is only drawn once
directly into the window. So enabling Blur while having Render to texture
disabled makes no sense (yes, the software should check this, but it does not
yet.)</p><p>I am currently not sure if blurring makes much sense. I personally
don't like the effect much.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2873625"></a>Fast rendering</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>While rotating the board using the cursor keys, to be exact while
one of the cursor keys is pressed down, some of the above mentioned display
improvements are temporary disabled to speed up the rotating. While rotating the
whole scene has to be redrawn quite often, so every unnecessary feature will
slow this down. And while the picture is moving, not the best quality is
required.</p><p>Once you release the key, the final scene will be drawn with all
settings enabled again. This should make rotating more efficient while the
quality drop should not be very noticeable during the movement. If you have a
fast computer, you can probably keep this disabled. Try and see if this makes a
significant performance difference.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2873654"></a>Scissor test</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>The OpenGL scissor test allows to only draw a part of the whole
scene instead of the complete view. The basic idea is: When adding just a single
stone, usually done by playing it or navigating forward in a game review, and
when there are no captures, then it is not really necassary to redraw the
complete board with all stones just to add this one additional stone. This is
especially true if there are quite a lot of stones, like more than 200, on the
board, when rendering all stones is getting slow. In such a case the scissor
test will prevent redrawing everything and only add the single new stone into
the otherwise unchanged scene.</p><p>Obviously there are some problems with this concept. When there are
captures, not only one stone has to be added but also other stones being
removed. If there are SGF marks on the board they must be removed. When going
through variations the ghost stones indicating branches need to be drawn or
removed. In all these cases too much changes on the board so the scissor test
makes no sense anymore. glGo will then automatically disable scissoring for such
a move and redraw the full scene. When playing or moving through a normal game
this is not much of a problem, as captures don't occur at every move, and when
they occur scissoring is automatically disabled. However, when looking at a game
with a lot of SGF markers, Kogos Joseki Dictionary being an extreme example, the
scissor test makes no sense and should be completely disabled.</p><p>Besides being not trivial, scissoring will produce some display
artifacts when the board is rotated. To sum it up, if you really need some speed
improvement, try this feature for normal games and switch it off for SGF editing
(or use the 2D board for this task). If your computer can handle the 3D board
without scissoring properly, then keep it disabled. But on my old P2 with 333
MHz scissoring is a significant performance boost with more than 200 stones on
the board.</p><p>Scissor test and render-to-texture both enabbled will create display
distortion. Enable only one of these features at the same time.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2873733"></a>Stone quality</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>Stone quality defines from how many triangles the wireframe of a
stone is built. Using more triangles obviously looks better and is slower. High
means a stone is created from 512 triangles, low means from 128 triangles. Why
triangles instead of quads? Because most graphiccards can draw triangles much
faster.</p><p>Any values above 512 don't improve the look anymore but get very
slow, so "High" definately means good enough.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2873756"></a>Marks</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>glGo supports a mark for the last move and a couple of common SGF
marks like square, triangles, letters etc.</p><p>There are two markers available for the last move mark:</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2873773"></a>Simple marks</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>Simple marks appear very similar to the Java version. A plain
circle is drawn on the stone - actually it is drawn inside the stone to avoid
odd effects when rotating the board.</p><p>The SGF marks like square, triangle, circle and cross marks are
always drawn as simple marks.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2873794"></a>Multitexture marks</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>Multitextures are an extension to OpenGL and is only available
when running in hardware mode. Most graphic cards should support multitextures.
Multitextures means, a second texture can be laid over the stone. The white
stones already have the grain texture, multitexture allows to add a second
texture with a mark. This makes the marks look realistic, as if painted over the
stone, and not floating above or inside the stone as the simple marks do. I
intentionally made a mark texture which looks "as if painted", instead of the
usual plain circle or cross. I think this looks pretty realistic. There is
currently one problem with these marks, when zooming in closely and rotating,
the marks slide over the stone. This has to be improved.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.jpg"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p>glGo will detect if your graphic card supports multitextures
