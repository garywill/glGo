without a proper 3D hardware driver !</p></td></tr></table></div><p>The goban display is available in two modes: 3D based on OpenGL and 2D
based on SDL. The SDL 2D board is pretty much looking the same as the gGo/Java
board. Some users might not have a graphic card with OpenGL support (but those
must be very old, any consumer card sold after 1998 supports OpenGL) or prefer
the classic 2D view, so the 2D mode might be an alternative.</p><p>The default is the 2D board (since version 0.0.5.4) as obviously a lot
of people have trouble with their OpenGL drivers and are unable to find the
documentation explaining the existance of an additional 2D board.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="images/tip.jpg"></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p>You can switch between 3D and 2D board display in the preferences
dialog.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>If you have a proper 3D graphic card, make sure you have some recent
driver from your hardware manufacturer installed. The default drivers that come
with Windows do <span class="emphasis"><em>NOT</em></span> work well.</p><p>The most common consumer cards should be from NVidia or ATI, all of
them will work properly with glGo if you have a NVidia or ATI driver installed.
Be careful with NVidia, there will be two drivers available for "NVidia Riva
TNT" card in the Windows driver selection: One from Microsoft and one from
NVidia. Use the NVidia one, the Microsoft driver is useless.</p><p>If you run Linux and don't have a hardware driver installed, the Mesa
libraries might work, but will be inferior to a real driver. There are both
NVidia and ATI drivers for Linux available (my old NVidia TNT 1 card works fine
with the latest NVidia/Linux driver).</p><p>The OpenGL mode won't work well without a hardware driver installed.
It will be slow and ugly. I am aware this is a serious limitation to the
program. Most gamers have those drivers up to date, but the average IGS user is
no computer gamer and certainly will have the default Microsoft Windows drivers
installed, which won't work with glGo.</p><p>The glGo sound system is based on the OpenAL or SDL mixer libraries.
Both are available and can be selected from the preferences dialog. OpenAL is
the default system and basically superior. Both OpenAL and SDL_mixer runtime
support are provided with the glGo Windows installer. On Linux you need to
install OpenAL and/or SDL mixer from your distribution, it is not included in
the glGo installer.</p><p>The SDL board requires the SDL, SDL_image, SDL_ttf and SDL_gfx
libraries. They are all included in the Windows installer, on Windows you don't
need anything additional. On Linux you require libsdl, libsdl_ttf and
libsdl_image, which skip with all major Linux distributions. It does not make
sense to include the SDL runtime libraries on Linux as they are all available
with your distribution already. There is "sdltest" program which will open the
SDL board only using the SDL libraries. If this works, it should work within
glGo, too. Hit the Space key to toggle through 19x19, 13x13 and 9x9 boards, 'c'
to toggle coordinates, 'f' to toggle fixed and scaled fonts.</p><p>glGo requires the Python 2.3 runtime library which is included in the
Windows installer. Linux users please install Python from their
distribution.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="index.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">glGo manual </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Installation</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
