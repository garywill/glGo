board using OpenGL or a 2D board using SDL. All new opened boards will use this
type. If you accessed the dialog from a board window, this current board will
not change it's type.</p><p>Since version 0.0.5.4 the 2D SDL board is the default, as some
people had problems getting their 3D drivers working and did not find this
switch to select the 2D board instead.

popup menu of the tray icon.</p></td></tr></table></div></li><li><p>Autohide startscreen</p><p>The startscreen will be minimized once you open a board or the
IGS terminal, so it gets out of the way. How exactly it is minimized, is defined
by the following option on Windows. On Windows it will be iconified if
<span class="guilabel">Autohide startscreen</span> is disabled, and minimized to the tray
if <span class="guilabel">Autohide startscreen</span> is enabled. On Linux, it will
simply be iconified.</p></li><li><p>Minimize to system tray (Windows only)</p><p>When <span class="guilabel">Autohide startscreen</span> is enabled, the
startscreen will minimize into the system tray. This was a feature request I got
for gGo/Java once and liked the idea very much, but it was not possible with
Java. Now it is. This will get the start window out of the way. When
<span class="guilabel">Autohide startscreen</span> is disabled, the start window will
still minimize to the tray when you click on its <span class="guibutton">Close</span>
button. When you click the <span class="guibutton">Exit</span> Button in the screen,
glGo will definately shutdown.</p><p>Maybe I will figure out how to use the KDE/Gnome taskbar for
this, but I suppose this is not too important now.</p></li><li><p>Enable tooltips</p><p>If you dislike tooltips, uncheck this to disable them
globally.</p></li><li><p>Reuse instance to open SGF files</p><p>If enabled, an already running glGo process will be reused to
open new SGF files to avoid starting a new glGo process for each SGF file you
open from a webbrowser or filemanager. The mechanism is similar to the one in
gGo. glGo will open a socket on localhost which is listening for incoming
connections. There is a small python script (standalone exe is available for
Windows) <tt class="filename">open_sgf.py/exe</tt> which will simply send its
argument to the glGo localhost socket if it finds such a socket. If no socket is
found, it will start a new glGo process to open the SGF file. This means, you
should not associate <tt class="filename">glGo</tt> with SGF files in your webbrowser
or filemanager, but <tt class="filename">open_sgf</tt> instead to avoid having a new
glGo opened for each file you open (assuming you want to use glGo as default SGF
viewer at all) and enable this option.</p><p>Additionally the Playermanager uses this feature to open its
games in glGo.</p><p>The <tt class="filename">glGo</tt> executable still accepts a SGF
file as argument, but this way you cannot reuse an already running glGo
instance. Of course, if you have lots of RAM available, you don't need to care
too much.</p><p>A note on security: On Linux the localserver uses Unix domain
sockets which is a secure mechanism unless you messed up your umask (but then
you got more serious problems anyways). The target file is
<tt class="filename">/tmp/glGo_socket</tt>. As the name suggest, Unix domain sockets
are not available on Windows, so on Windows an Internet domain socket is used,
which is naturally insecure. The socket is running on port 9998 (most likely
unused, gGo uses 9999). If you have a firewall, you should be secure against
malicious attacks. If you run Windows without a firewall, then glGo can indeed
be a security risk (as is gGo), but then you have much more serious threats to
worry about than someone hacking your Go client, I suppose.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2872951"></a>Sound settings</h3></div></div><div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Global sound</p><p>If unchecked, all sounds are turned off. If you see this
checkbox disabled, for some reason the sound libraries failed to load. Please
check the glGo logfile.</p></li><li><p>Sound type</p><p>You can select the <a href="ar01s09.html" title="OpenAL Sound System">OpenAL</a> or
<a href="ar01s08.html" title="SDL Information">SDL Mixer</a> sound system here. On Windows both give
about equal sound quality. On Linux I found the SDL Mixer better than OpenAL.
However, this might depend very much on your sound hardware and driver, so you
should just try yourself which system gives you a better result.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.jpg"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p>Switching from one sound system to the other might or

available now. If things still fail, start glGo from the command line and

and in the main IGS terminal. When disabled, they will only be shown in the
shouts frame.</p></li><li><p>Skip guests in player list</p><p>When enabled, guest accounts will not be shown in the player
list.</p></li><li><p>Display info dialogs</p><p>When disabled, informations about observed games like results,
adjourning etc. will not be shown in a dialog. These dialogs might be
occasionally a bit annoying when observing multiple games, so this option offers
you to turn these messageboxes off. For own games (well, once they are
implemented...) this option has no effect.</p></li><li><p>Ayt timer</p><p>If enabled, glGo will send the &#8220;<span class="quote">ayt</span>&#8221; command (Are
you there?) every five minutes to IGS to prevent the server logging you out due
to idle time early. However, this feature won't keep you online for an infinite
time, when you are you idle too long, the timer will stop. But you should be
online long enough to observe complete games without worrying about a
disconnection.</p><p>This feature has one disadvantage: Your idle time in the player
list will never go above 5 minutes, so to other users you appear to be present
while you might be not. Keep that in mind when using this feature.</p><p>Enabling or disabling the ayt timer takes effect on the next
connection to IGS.</p></li><li><p>Ignore rank limit for friends</p><p>If this option is enabled, the current rank limit in the player
table (for example 1d-3k or something) is ignored when you use the "Friends"
filter. The idea is, you probably want to see all your friends, from 9p-NR, if
you use the Friends button. However, this requires some additional work as the
player list needs to be reread. This is the behaviour known from gGo.</p><p>If disabled, the rank limit will also be applied when you turn
on the Friends filter. This is the old behaviour of glGo. It is faster as the
player list does not need to be reloaded from IGS.</p></li><li><p>Sound for chats</p><p>If enabled, you will be notified about incoming tells with a
sound. Every chat window has an own button to enable or disable sound for this
chat session individually. So if you enabled sound for chats, you can still
disable it for individual chats, or vice versa.</p></li><li><p>Sound for match requests</p><p>When enabled you will be notified with a sound when you receive
a match request.</p></li><li><p>Time warning</p><p>Here you can configure time warning for your own games. If your
byoyomi time runs below the warning threshold, the clock will blink to notify
you. Additionally you can configure if you want to get a warning
sound.</p><p>To disable time warning set the threshold to
zero.</p></li><li><p>Autosave</p><p>You can let glGo automatically save all finished own and/or
observed games by enabling the autosave options. You should define a target
directory where the SGF files are saved to. For example, I have a directory
<tt class="filename">IGS/own</tt> and <tt class="filename">IGS/observed</tt> to keep own and observed games
seperated. You can save both into the same directory if you want. </p><p>This feature is meant for interaction with the SGF indexing of
the Playermanager to collect games associated with certain players you might be
interested in.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s05.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s07.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Playing with GNU Go </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> OpenGL Information</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
